# Phase 1, Lecture 3: DOM Events

## Lecture Topics

- HTML forms
- .preventDefault()
- .addEventListener()
- Handling click and submit events

## Introduction

Today we'll be continuing to build our app for the Flatburger restaurant that displays a menu of food served at the restaurant. We will be adding a feature that displays information for one of the menu items including the name, image, and description for the menu item within a food detail section of the page when the image for the menu item is clicked within the menu. We will also be adding a feature that allows a user to add a new food to the menu using an HTML form. We will be using the concepts learned in this lecture to build out this app.

## Setup

- Open the `index.html` file on your browser
