# Phase 1, Lecture 5: POST Requests

## Lecture Topics

- POST
- Pessimistic vs. Optimistic Rendering

## Introduction

Today we will continue to build our app for the Flatburger restaurant. We will use fetch() to make a POST request to the JSON server (db.json) in response to form submission to add a new food object to the database in addition to updating the frontend (our webpage) to include the data for the new food. We will be using the concepts learned in this lecture to build out this app.

## Setup

- Open the `index.html` file on your browser
- If you are coding along, write your code in the `index.js` file
